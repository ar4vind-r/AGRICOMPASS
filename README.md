# AGRICOMPASS
AgriCompass is an intelligent decision-support system designed to help farmers choose the best crops based on both agronomic suitability and market profitability. It combines soil analysis with real-time price forecasting to deliver personalized, data-driven recommendations.

✅ Personalized Crop Recommendations

AgriCompass analyzes soil parameters and matches them with ideal crops, ensuring high suitability and better yield.

💹 Price Forecasting

Predicts future market prices for major crops using machine-learning models, helping farmers plan more profitably.

🔄 Agronomic + Economic Integration

The system uniquely merges soil data and pricing trends, offering a complete and practical recommendation.

🛠️ Tech Stack

-Python/n-Pandas, NumPy – Data handling
-Scikit-learn – Machine learning models
-Matplotlib/Seaborn – Visualization (if used)
-Flask / Streamlit – For the web interface (if applicable)

🧠 How It Works

-Selecting panchyat
(to get soil details )
-User inputs soil parameters
(NPK values, pH, rainfall, etc.)
-Model suggests suitable crops
based on agronomic matching.
-Price prediction model forecasts market price
for the recommended crops.
-System ranks the best options
considering both soil and market conditions.

📈 Algorithms Used

-Random Forest Classifier – Crop recommendation
-Linear Regression / ARIMA / Random Forest Regressor – Price forecasting
-Normalization & Feature Engineering – Data preprocessing
