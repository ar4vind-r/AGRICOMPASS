# AGRICOMPASS
AgriCompass is an intelligent decision-support system designed to help farmers choose the best crops based on both agronomic suitability and market profitability. It combines soil analysis with real-time price forecasting to deliver personalized, data-driven recommendations.

## ✅ Personalized Crop Recommendations

AgriCompass analyzes soil parameters and matches them with ideal crops, ensuring high suitability and better yield.

## 💹 Price Forecasting

Predicts future market prices for major crops using machine-learning models, helping farmers plan more profitably.

## 🔄 Agronomic + Economic Integration

The system uniquely merges soil data and pricing trends, offering a complete and practical recommendation.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

-Python<br>
-Pandas, NumPy – Data handling<br>
-Scikit-learn – Machine learning models<br>
-Matplotlib/Seaborn – Visualization (if used)<br>
-Flask / Streamlit – For the web interface (if applicable)<br>

## 🧠 How It Works

-Selecting panchyat (to get soil details )<br>
-User inputs soil parameters (NPK values, pH, rainfall, etc.)<br>
-Model suggests suitable crops based on agronomic matching.<br>
-Price prediction model forecasts market price for the recommended crops.<br>
-System ranks the best options considering both soil and market conditions.<br>

## 📈 Algorithms Used

-Random Forest Classifier – Crop recommendation<br>
-Linear Regression / ARIMA / Random Forest Regressor – Price forecasting<br>
-Normalization & Feature Engineering – Data preprocessing<br>
